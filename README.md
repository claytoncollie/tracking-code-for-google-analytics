Simple, lightweight solution for inserting your Google Analytics Universal tracking code.

## Description

Tracking Code For Google Analytics is a simple, lightweight WordPress plugin for inserting your Google Analytics Universal Analytics tracking code. The plugin does one thing and one thing only; prints the standard Google Analytics tacking script to the `<head>` of your website. To insert your tracking ID, navigate to Settings > General and then scroll to the bottom of the page.

### Composer

```php
composer require claytoncollie/tracking-code-for-google-analytics
```

### Filters

If you want to set the tracking ID without using the wp-admin user interface, use the filter below.

```php
add_filter(
	'tracking_code_for_google_analytics_id',
	/**
	 * Set Google Analytics tracking ID.
	 *
	 * @param string $tracking_id Tracking ID.
	 *
	 * @return string
	 */
	function ( string $tracking_id ) : string {
		$tracking_id 

### 'UA-7654321';

		return $tracking_id;
	}
);
```

### Definitions

You can also define the tracking ID in your wp-config.php file with the following snippet.

```php
define( 'TRACKING_CODE_FOR_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID', 'UA-7654321' );
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why did I build this plugin?

The plugins I have used in the past to solve this problem have too many features for my liking. This plugin is comprised two functions. One for registering a settings field on the Options General page. And another for printing the tracking code to the frontend. I want a lightweight solution for the websites that I build without all of the extra bells and whistles. If you are expecting this plugin to do more or grow in the future, please do not use it.

### Where is the tracking code inserted?

The tracking code is inserted into the `<head>` section.

### Will this plugin slow down my website?

No. This plugin is intentionally lightweight. All it does is register a settings field, saves to the database, and then inserts the tracking code. Nothing more.

### I found a bug. How do I report it?
